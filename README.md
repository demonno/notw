notw - No Trailing Whitespace


If you have difficulty of creating file without trailing whitespace,
visit here https://boiling-bastion-69478.herokuapp.com/ and do it just in one click.

##Inspired by edx CS169.1x HW2: Sinatra Hangperson

    NOTE: When you create your URL submission file, some text editors add 
    whitespace to the end of files (e.g. vim). To make this file in a secure 
    way use the following command in a 
    Unix shell: echo -n "YOUR_URL" > submission_file.txt. 
    If all of the tests fail with a SocketError, 
    make sure that your submission file has no trailing whitespace.

It is already tested several times and made a as successful submission on edx.org using file which was generated by this code.
